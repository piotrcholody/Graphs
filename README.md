# Graphs

# Lab_01

Simple random graphs generator by propability or amount of edges. All graphs can be represented in three ways: adjacency list, incidence or connection matrix.

# Lab_02

Generator for graphs with given ranks of vertexes or sequence, random euler graphs, random regular graphs. Option to check if graph is euler or hamilton.

# Lab_03

Consistent graph generator with ranked edges. Shortest path by Dijkstra algorithm and center of the graph.
